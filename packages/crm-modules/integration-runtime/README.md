# Integration Runtime

Business-neutral runtime primitives for provider integrations: deadlines, retry classification, rate/concurrency limits, circuit breaking, redaction, telemetry, Webhook verification interfaces, replay protection, and test fault injection.

Owning platform or domain modules define vendor-neutral capability ports and retain business facts. Concrete provider adapters are composed by `apps/api` or `apps/worker`; domain modules never import provider SDKs or call arbitrary external URLs through this package.

The first stage contains no payment, SMS, WeCom push, WeChat notification, course-platform, question-bank, or AI adapter. See [ADR-0020](../../../docs/08-架构决策/ADR-0020-第三方集成运行时与供应商适配器.md), the [module description](../../../docs/03-模块说明/第三方集成运行时.md), and the [first-stage scope](../../../docs/01-权威与基线/第一阶段第三方集成范围.md).

Future AI Provider Adapters may reuse this package's deadlines, rate limits, retry classification, redaction, and telemetry, but AI use-case registration, prompt/model/data policy, budgets, structured proposals, and human-review semantics belong to `ai-gateway`. See [ADR-0024](../../../docs/08-架构决策/ADR-0024-AI网关与AI治理边界.md).

## Public boundary

- `createIntegrationExecutor` runs a capability-owned callback; it never accepts a URL, provider DTO, credential, or arbitrary payload.
- Operation policy declares connect, response, and total deadlines, operation safety, bounded retry delays, jitter, and an explicit transient-error allowlist. The single total deadline covers limiter waiting, every attempt, and retry backoff; non-idempotent writes must use one attempt.
- Adapter callbacks must observe the supplied `AbortSignal` and settle after cancellation. The runtime waits for settlement so an operation cannot silently continue past its caller's transaction or lifecycle boundary.
- Concurrency, rate-limit, circuit and observer snapshots contain only bounded technical identifiers and categories. Request/response bodies and provider payloads are never passed to observers.
- Observer failures are isolated and never change operation success, error classification, or retry behavior.
- `acceptVerifiedWebhook` validates bounded metadata and timestamp, invokes a provider-owned raw-body signature verifier, then atomically reserves independent hashed event-ID and nonce replay keys before returning a receipt. It never parses business data.
- Production composition must inject an atomic durable `WebhookReplayStore`. `createInMemoryReplayStore` is exported only from `@ai-crm/crm-integration-runtime/testing` and is not a production correctness mechanism.

Concrete capability policy, provider error mapping, credentials, endpoints, replay retention, authorization, audit and reconciliation remain owned by the approved capability and Adapter composition task.
