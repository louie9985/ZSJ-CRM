# Task Center

Maintains a unified projection of work assigned by workflows and future business systems. Source systems remain authoritative for the underlying business state.

Commands are routed back to the source system; this module never completes a Flowable task or changes domain state on its own. Projection updates are idempotent, version-aware, replayable, and repairable through reconciliation.

## Public boundary

- `apply` consumes a validated, transport-neutral lifecycle event. Callers may pass an `AbortSignal`; the signal reaches transaction acquisition and every PostgreSQL statement. The runtime must cancel the active operation and must never return an aborted connection to the pool or allow late work to use it. The durable store records the event receipt and projection in one transaction; a repeated event is stable and an older source version cannot replace a newer projection.
- `list` and `get` fail closed and re-run server-side authorization. List results are filtered per projection rather than trusting client visibility.
- `complete` durably reserves an idempotency key and routes the command through `TaskSourceCommandRouter`. An accepted command does not close the projection; only a later authoritative lifecycle event can do so.
- `reconcile` is an authorized operation that reads one authoritative source snapshot and applies the same version rules as event replay.

Deep links contain only reviewed stable `appId` and `routeId` identifiers. URLs and route payloads are not accepted or persisted. Source adapters must honor the provided idempotency key because a timeout after remote acceptance is retried.

## Operations

Run the additive migration through the repository migration runner. Runtime startup must not synchronize schemas. `DATABASE_MIGRATION_URL_FILE` is required by the package migration entry point and must reference a non-empty Secret file.

Telemetry contains operation, outcome, and duration only. Authorization denial, storage/audit failure, a source outage, and an in-progress command are explicit failures; none is reported as task completion. PostgreSQL integration tests run in an isolated Compose project with `pnpm --filter @ai-crm/platform-task-center test:integration`.

The Prisma persistence runtime performs AbortSignal checks before and after statements and before transaction commit. It explicitly reports `queryInterruptionSupport: false`, so cancellation does not claim to interrupt an already executing PostgreSQL query; `statement_timeout` bounds that wait and an observed abort still prevents commit. The legacy PostgreSQL runtime may advertise `abortSignalSupport: true`, in which case active-query interruption is additionally verified.
